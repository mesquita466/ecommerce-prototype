# simple-login-screen
This is my first login system with PHP integrated into the database. Given the simplicity, you might be better off ignoring it unless you want to see something really simple. (maybe part of the code is in Portuguese)

1 - don't forget to start apache and mysql server
2 - create a database called "bdti95" or any other name (if you choose another name, you will need to change the value of the variable "db_name" inside the file "connection.php"
3 - inside the "db" folder there is the data structure import file, it already contains some random data for testing
4 - feel free to use this template
