# ecommerce-prototype
This is an ecommerce prototype and my first "big" academic prototype. Feel free to use like a template or contributing.  

1 - don't forget to start apache and mysql server.  

2 - create a database called "bdti95" or any other name (if you choose another name, you will need to change the value of the variable "db_name" inside the file "connection.php".   

3 - inside the "db" folder there is the data structure import file, it already contains some random data for testing.   

4 - feel free to use this template.
